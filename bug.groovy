```groovy
def myMethod(param) {
  if (param == null) {
    return 0 //This is the problematic line
  }
  // ... rest of the method
}
```
This code snippet has a potential bug related to null handling. While it aims to handle a null input by returning 0, it may throw exceptions later if other parts of the code don't properly handle the 0 value as a valid output in cases where a non-zero value is expected or assumed.
